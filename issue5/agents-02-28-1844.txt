AGENTS. *

_ We have named a large numBer of gentle-
men for Local and ‘Traveling Agents. Wo
will give our reasons for so doing. As this pa-
per is of a general nature, and for the benefit
of the whole people, the Committee thought it
expedient to select the number that will be
found below, with the privilege, at their own
discretion, of acting either as Local or 'Trave
eling Agents, and as we have proposed their
names, we hope each one will act.
