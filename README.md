# data

Image file nomenclature: <br/>
i = issue number <br/>
p = page number <br/>
c = column number <br/>

tableOfContent.cvs -> image content <br/>
agentInfo.cvs -> cleaned agent information <br/>
subscriberReceipt.csv -> list of subscribers <br/>

Impressive! I can see some clean-up needed to fix OCR's mistake. But, the three files show a big progress!
